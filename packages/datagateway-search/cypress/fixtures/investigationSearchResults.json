        "summary": "This project determines the nanoscale structure of carbide derived carbon, as well as a carbon molecular sieve, by hybrid reverse Monte Carlo simulation. Our simulation will fit the pair distribution function and the sp3/sp2 bonding ratio, while minimising energy, to determine the carbon nanostructure. The use of the hybridisation state represents a significant advance that will enable accurate representation of short-range ordering, and thereby of local constrictions that affect fluid accessibility. The knowledge of the nanoscale structure will allow optimisation of synthesis conditions for efficient application of the carbons in separation processes, gas storage, and as supercapacitors. For the carbon molecular sieve the atomistic structure is urgently needed to simulate quantum effects during transport of hydrogen isotopes in this material, data for which has recently been obtained.",

        "summary": "The direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen offers a cleaner more atom efficient alternative to the current commercial production process for this important commodity chemical. We have shown that the incorporation of Au in to Pd catalysts to form supported nanoalloys gives catalysts that synthesise H2O2 with high selectivities in the absence of acid and halide stabilisers. Particularly high activity is observed when an activated carbon is used as a support. However, the activity is very dependent on the choice of carbon. The aim of this proposal is to use to TOSCA to compare two carbons that lead to very different catalyst activities with a view to understanding what are the properties of the support requred for good activity.",

Recently we have investigated the proton dynamics of type 1 glassy carbon as a non-graphitising carbon (maximum service temperature under argon: 1000°C) on TOSCA. The aim of this proposal is to extend the study to type 2 glassy carbons  (for maximum service temperature under argon: 3000°C) and to compare this to ordered and disordered acetylene blacks (very clean, high sp2 character).",

        "summary": "Hard carbons are amongst the most promising anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, but their charge storage mechanisms are still poorly understood. Difficulties in characterizing their structures have led to a lack of detailed structure-property relationships. Their lack of long-range correlations, along with the formation of otherwise disordered, metastable, phases upon discharge hinders structural characterization. Here, we propose to study the formation of hard carbons resulting from different synthesis conditions using pair distribution function analysis to gain information about how the synthesis conditions affect the structure of the resultant carbon. This will be combined with electrochemical, Raman and solid-state NMR measurements in order to better understand the relationship between the carbon structure, its synthesis conditions and its behavior within a battery.",

        "summary": "Confined fluids in nanometer-sized pores exhibit remarkably different properties compared to bulk fluids at similar thermodynamic conditions. The morphology of pores such as size, surface area, and volume plays a crucial role to decide the fluid uptake capacity for H2 storage and CO2 capture.  Recently, in-situ neutron diffraction measurements covering a wide-q range at different loading of CO2 in microporous activated carbon was carried out at NIMROD and unusual crowding of the CO2 molecules in the pores, formed by crumpled sheets, is observed.  A new generation microporous carbon (DFNC) is developed using Dendritic Fibrous Nanosilica (DFNS) as a hard template and it shows unusual higher CO2 uptake compared to activated carbon studied before. The present proposal aims to probe the generation DFNC microporous carbon using in-situ diffraction covering both small-angle and wide angles.  ",

Recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements confirmed the role of optimal pore dimension in compressing and densifying the adsorbed hydrogen. However, the effects of pore geometry on hydrogen densification of nanoporous materials are still unclear. This proposal is designed to correlate the pore geometries of a select range of carbon nanomaterials with the levels of hydrogen densification observed using neutron scattering, to determine the optimal pore geometries needed for higher-performing nanoporous carbon hydrogen storage materials.",
