Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Reporting Bugs

1. Use the [GitHub issue search](https://github.com/ral-facilities/datagateway/issues) -- check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check if the issue has been fixed -- try to reproduce it with the latest code
3. Isolate the problem -- ideally create a [minimal example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
4. [Create an issue](https://github.com/ral-facilities/datagateway/issues/new) -- provide as much relevant detail as possible.

A good bug report should contain all the information necessary to allow a developer to reproduce the issue, without needing to ask for further information.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? 

All of these details assist the process of investigating and fixing bugs.

## Requesting Features

Feature requests are welcome. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

[Create an issue](https://github.com/ral-facilities/datagateway/issues/new) to describe the feature.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.
